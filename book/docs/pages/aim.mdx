# Aim

The aim of a game of PAVED is to score as many points as possible.

As tiles are laid, **Cities**, **Roads**, **Wonders** and **Forests** are formed and developed. Placing your **Characters** on these tiles gives you the opportunity to accumulate points, which are scored when structures are closed/completed. 

In multiplayer mode, the player who has scored the most points at the end of the game is the winner. There is no turn taking. Players may lay tiles as rapidly as their fingers allow.
