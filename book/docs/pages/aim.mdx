# Aim

The aim of a game of PAVED is to score as many points as possible.

As tiles are laid, **Cities**, **Roads** and **Wonders** are formed and developed. Placing your **Characters** on these tiles gives you the opportunity to accumulate points, which are scored when structures are closed/completed.
