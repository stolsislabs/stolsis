# Pave

Confirm the tile placement and location of the character (if applicable) by clicking `✔️`.

The tile will be paved and the character will appear in the selected position on the board.

Once confirmed, the next tile will reveal in the viewer.

:::note
Note: to pave a tile without placing a character, simply ignore the **Character** step. If the structure is closed by paving the tile, the character will immidiately return to the player's hand.
