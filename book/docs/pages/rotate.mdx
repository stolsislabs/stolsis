# Rotate

Rotate the tile appropriately so that it coordinates with the surrounding structures. When a tile is appropriately oriented, its highlight will change from **red** to **green**.

If it is not appropriately oriented, the player will be unable to confirm (pave) it.

Rotate the tile in clockwise steps by clicking `↩️`.
