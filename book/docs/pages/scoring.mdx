# Scoring

Points are scored when structures are closed. Certain character bonuses exist (see **Characters**), as well as bonuses for growing larger cities and roads.

## Tiles

Each tile has a points value. Once a structure is closed, a player is rewarded an accumulation of points according to the total tiles within it.

## Growing Cities & Roads

Cities and roads have an ever increasing multiplier bonus system according to the number of tiles within them. This is outlined in the following curve, where **y=1.0235^x**.
