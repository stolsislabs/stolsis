## Description

PAVED pays homage to the classic multiplayer tile laying board game Carcassonne, but onchain and with its own twists.

In our initial release, players are introduced to **The Perpetual Puzzle** - a thoughtful and methodical game which involves strategically paving tiles on an expanding map, constructing various map features to score points. Each day at **00:00 UTC**, a fresh deck of **38** tiles (randomly selected from a larger deck of **72**) marks the beginning of a new 24hr, automated competition. To make things really challenging, the order in which each tile appears depends on the the placement of the previous tile.

Will you top the day's leaderboard and be crowned **Pioneer of The Perpetual Puzzle**?
