## Description

PAVED pays homage to the classic multiplayer tile laying board game Carcassonne, but onchain and with its own twists.

In this game, players have the choice to play both **Solo** and **Multiplayer** modes. Whilst solo mode is a slower, more thoughtful and methodical game, multiplayer mode offers a fast-paced and intense experience.

Both modes involve players strategically paving tiles to construct various map features. Players must place characters on their tiles to influence the allegiance of the developing features and secure points, which they accumulate over the course of a game.

Tile sets are comprised of uniquely styled pieces, encompassing over **37** distinct types. This extensive variety results in an expansive range of possibilities, ensuring a genuinely distinctive building experience every time.

### Solo Mode

Solo mode involves scoring as many points as possible using a finite, shuffled deck of **72** tiles. There is no time limit. Players compete for honour and success hinges on high-level strategic thinking.

### Multiplayer Mode

Multiplayer mode also involves scoring as many points as possible. However, this time players do not only construct map features, but have the opportunity to challenge _other_ players features, and must defend their own. Tiles are randomly drawn from a shuffled deck of **99** tiles, and games are time based (predetermined by the gameâ€™s host). Once the deck is exhausted, it is reset and randomised, then play continues. Beyond individual strategy, success hinges on shrewd tactics and decisiveness.
