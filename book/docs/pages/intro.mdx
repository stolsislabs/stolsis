## Lore

:::note
_Stolsli, the first documented Realm, lies in ruins, the aftermath of a century-long war filled with hard-fought battles and uncelebrated heroes.
The Orders have mustered, and all take charge to claim Stolsli for their own.
Pitted against one another, they amass their troops and embark on an unrelenting journey, endeavouring to construct, break, and plunder everything that Paved possesses.
The looming question remains: Will this war persist for another century, or even longer?
Or will a single Order emerge from the annals of history, laying claim to the battered but coveted realm of Stolsli?_

## Description

Paved pays homage to the classic multiplayer tile-laying board game Carcassonne, but on-chain and with its own twists.
In this game, 16 rival Loot Orders clash on an ever-expanding, player-driven map.
Players align themselves with one of these Orders, acquiring map tiles and strategically constructing or challenging various features to accumulate points.
Success hinges on shrewd tactics, and effective collaboration within the Orders is vital for achieving dominance.

Each player possesses a finite set of characters, each influencing the allegiance of features on the map.
The outcome of these territorial contests depends on the formation of closed structures, which in turn determines the allocation of points.

The game offers an enduring experience with an infinite supply of tiles.
Victory is decided on a seasonal basis, with rewards distributed to the triumphant Order.
Each new season seamlessly continues from the previous one, preserving the existing map and fostering the growth of an ever-expanding, player-crafted world.

Tiles are randomly drawn from a diverse stack of uniquely styled pieces, encompassing over **99** distinct tile types.
This extensive variety results in an expansive range of possibilities, ensuring a genuinely distinctive building experience throughout the game.
