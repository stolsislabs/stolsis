## Description

PAVED pays homage to the classic multiplayer tile laying board game Carcassonne, but onchain and with its own twists.

In our initial release, players are introduced to **Puzzle** mode - a thoughtful and methodical game, which involves strategically paving tiles on an expanding map to construct various map features. Placing characters in or on those features before closing them scores points, of which you're trying to score as many as possible using a finite deck of **37** tiles. A fresh, randomised seed marks the beginning of a new 24hr, automated competition at 00:00 UTC every single da! Compete against your fellow Pavers in the ultimate PAVED shared gaming experience.


**Lord of The Board** & **Multiplayer** modes coming soon ðŸ‘€
