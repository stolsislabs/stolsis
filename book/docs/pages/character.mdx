# Character

A character _**can**_ be played on a tile before or after the tile has been placed (**but must be before it is paved**).

Once a character has been chosen, select the location on the tile that you wish to place the character, as per the white markers indicated on the tile placer.

Characters can only be played on the current tile 'in hand'.

Only appropriate characters can be chosen for the structure you are building.

<div align="center">
    <img width="550" src="character.gif" alt="character" />
</div>

:::note
Note: tiles can (and will) be paved without placing a character.
